# Things to do

 - Notification for a plain crit
 - Make messages box lighter grey, contrast is bad on big screen
 - Improve randomness of rolls https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues
 - Create admin report that runs locally or only when I'm logged in so I can delete old channels and manage data
 - Add "Information Gathering" and "Engagement" as special rolls with labelled results
